5</span>NIELS EBBESEN.</h2>
<p>All his men the Count collects,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And from Slesvig marched away;<br />
Never such as host was seen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or before or since that day.</p>
<p>Into Denmark marched the Count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Followed by so fair a band;<br />
Banners twenty-four they bore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Power like theirs might none withstand.</p>
<p>Gert the Count to Randers rode,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bad counsel lending ear;<br />
For from old it stood foretold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He should end there his career.</p>
<p><!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>He would not the place avoid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But seemed bent to tempt his fate;<br />
Of the rural lords and thanes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He the quarters up will beat.</p>
<p>Knights and freeborn men apart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There trooped eighteen thousand bows;<br />
Forty thousand made they all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who could such a host oppose?</p>
<p>To Niels Ebbesen the Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Word to appear before him sent;<br />
And safe convoy him he gave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which should doubt and fear prevent.</p>
<p>Gert the Count met Ebbesen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; North of Randers by the sea:<br />
&ldquo;Welcome be, Niels Ebbesen!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Say how matters stand with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Niels stretched the Count his hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to parleying straight they go;<br />
There was little then of jest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of dallying less, I trow.</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Sir Niels Ebbesen, thou art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome as the flowers in spring;<br />
How stand minds in North Jutland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thence what tidings dost thou bring?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say how all thy wealthy friends<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy heart&rsquo;s loved lady are;<br />
Which dost wish for at my hands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Smiling peace, or bloody war?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well stand minds in North Jutland,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each man&rsquo;s courage there&rsquo;s erect;<br />
Say, dost come as friend or foe?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What from thee may we expect?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have kindred in the North,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men of wealth and noble race;<br />
Shouldst thou it require of them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be ready for thy Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise art thou, Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thy prudence none can doubt;<br />
When thou canst not straightway hit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Widely then thou ridst about.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Hear thou, Sir Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou must on mine errand ride;<br />
Say, how many men thou hast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brought, on whom thou mayst confide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindred, Sir, I have, and friends,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mongst the hardy Jutlanders;<br />
Willingly they follow me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the stormy strife of spears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have brought, such as they are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With me thirty mounted men;<br />
Be they fewer, or be they more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear are they to Ebbesen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hast thou with thee thirty lads?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That seems but a scanty force;<br />
Yester e&rsquo;en at Sir Bugge&rsquo;s Gate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood&rsquo;st thou with a hundred horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Backward Ebbesen recoiled,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with high flushed cheek replied:<br />
&ldquo;He nor knight nor gentleman<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is, who me hath thus belied.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>&ldquo;Be it man or woman who<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my face dares that to say,<br />
Till I&rsquo;ve answered suitably,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er from him I&rsquo;ll flinch
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, dear Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We thereof will talk no more;<br />
To thy friend Sir Bugge ride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Him to serve me true win o&rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your errand I shall do,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And to Bugge bold repair,<br />
From thy part what I&rsquo;m to say<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; First to me thou must declare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bugge bold has me defied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Young Poul Glob has done the same;<br />
Anders Frost makes one of them,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Him your Chief &rsquo;tis said ye name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And e&rsquo;en thou, Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain courtiers hast with thee,<br />
Who have eaten of my bread,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And have basely quitted me.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;First there is young Eske Frost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And his stalwart brothers two;<br />
Without leave of mine obtained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From my service they withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More there are whom I&rsquo;ve obliged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And who pay me now no heed;<br />
If to Bugge&rsquo;s rede you list<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon ye&rsquo;ll see how you will speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nought of Bugge&rsquo;s rede I know,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What he&rsquo;ll do or leave undone;<br />
Eske thy true servant was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast no blame that knight upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eske Frost&rsquo;s a gallant man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Guards his honour like his eye;<br />
Sought he his discharge to gain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why to him didst it deny?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Custom &rsquo;tis in Danish land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And has been from days of eld,<br />
That the man who will not serve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall not be to serve compell&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;No two things, save Monk and cowl,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are for aye together tied;<br />
As they loathe or like their place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Courtmen ride away or bide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Count Sir Gert, could not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such like reasoning understand:<br />
&ldquo;No one ought to quit his lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whilst that lord would him command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Sir Niels, too long thou hast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here stood idly chattering;<br />
Either thou shalt Denmark quit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or thou shalt on gallows swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Neath safe convoy since thou&rsquo;rt come<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou shalt go withouten hurt;<br />
To thy cost else thou should&rsquo;st learn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What it is to anger Gert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thy princely passport hold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it avail or not;<br />
If thou do me aught of harm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Infamy thy name will blot.</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Thieves mayst thou on gallows hang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be torn by carn and crow;<br />
For thy threat from native land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wife, and child, I will not go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if me from native land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my wife and babes you chase,<br />
Thou shalt soon, for certainty,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rue thou e&rsquo;er hast seen my face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride away, Sir Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly hence thyself betake,<br />
Or I will, as well I can,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On thy skull the helmet break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None e&rsquo;er saw me so adread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But that I could tremble still, <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a><br />
Hear, Count Gert! look to thyself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Guard thee from approaching ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ebbesen, thou tirest me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Suffering thus thy tongue to run;<br />
Till to-morrow thou art safe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even till the set of sun.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;This, and the next day till eve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou for me shalt be at rest;<br />
But no belted knight am I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I be not soon thy guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swift away rode Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shook his iron-gloved fist in air:<br />
&ldquo;That I soon shall come again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Sir Count, in memory bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forward rode Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spurred his steed till blood outflew;<br />
With his men the Count remained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No one dared the knight pursue.</p>
<p>Till he reached his Castellaye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still he rode withouten rest;<br />
To his dear Dame he complained,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Begged of her her counsel best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here thou sitt&rsquo;st, dear Housewife mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What advice canst thou bestow?<br />
Gert will drive me from the land,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hath declared himself my foe.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>&ldquo;To my choice three things he put,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Least of all I liked the third;<br />
I should join him, or the land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quit, or hang, such was his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! what counsel can I give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From my simple woman&rsquo;s mind?<br />
The most desperate counsel&rsquo;s best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we but that counsel find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most desperate counsel&rsquo;s best,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If we can but it discover;<br />
Either slay the tyrant, or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burn the house the tyrant over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the smithy lead your steeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let them all be shod anew;<br />
Turn ye all the heels afore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus your trace will cheat the view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn ye all the heels afore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Track ye thus, I ween, can no man;<br />
Never tell to mortal wight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast learnt this from a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;Here my gallant swains ye sit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merry-making o&rsquo;er your drink;<br />
Every lad who loves his lord<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his lord now must not shrink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up then rose the Courtmen bold,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take on anew agreed;<br />
Save Sir Niels&rsquo; sister&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From his uncle would recede.</p>
<p>Swore the knights a solemn oath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That for him their lives they&rsquo;d stake,<br />
And with him would dauntless ride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wheresoe&rsquo;er a fray he&rsquo;d make.</p>
<p>So they rode to Fruerlund,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From their steeds they there dismount;<br />
Into Randers then they walked,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To beat up the hairless Count.</p>
<p>It was Sir Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the bridge of Randers came:<br />
&ldquo;He who&rsquo;s loath to follow me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Straightway his discharge may claim.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Forward stepped the tiny Frost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought the truest of the true:<br />
&ldquo;Give me my dismissal, Sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me horse and saddle too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he sought and got discharge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saddle got and steed withall;<br />
But he served his master best<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That same day ere evening fall.</p>
<p>To the Count&rsquo;s door rode Sir Niels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ne&rsquo;er from that withdrew his look;<br />
Thrice thereon with iron lance<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heavily the hero strook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rise up from thy sleep, my lord!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me in right speedily;<br />
Thy dear brother, Henrik Count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has dispatched me unto thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my brother if thou&rsquo;rt sent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rest thee from thy journey long;<br />
Me to-morrow in the Kirk<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meet &rsquo;twixt mass and matin song.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;Let your page but at the door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take from me the entrusted scroll;<br />
Ribe hard invested is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Colding town is burnt to coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ribe hard invested is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Colding&rsquo;s burnt, and Vedel&rsquo;s flung<br />
Open to our troops its gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Niels Ebbesen is hung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what thou hast told be truth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; News it is to make one gay;<br />
Thou shalt in respect be held<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Herald till thy dying day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Page! no more keep fast the door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me on the herald gaze;<br />
For that we the land have won<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the sum of what he says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the window went the Count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thence his eye the lances caught:<br />
&ldquo;Ha! Niels Ebbesen&rsquo;s at hand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curse the hour I Denmark sought.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Fierce with shields the doors they banged,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burst the locks with frequent blow:<br />
&ldquo;Hairless Count! art thou within?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hairless Count, we pledge thee now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set thee down, Niels Ebbesen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall things accommodate;<br />
Let us send to Henrik Count,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Claus Krummedige straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so yesterday didst thou<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak, Sir Count, by Randers strand;<br />
Then thou saidst that I should hang,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or should quit my native land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up and spoke the Count&rsquo;s footpage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kinsman he to Ebbesen:<br />
&ldquo;By his words if ye be fooled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lost art thou and all thy men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up and spoke the black young page,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Black because he was not white:<br />
&ldquo;Straight desist from useless talk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let, I rede, your faulchions bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no castles, Sir, which can<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such a prisoner long contain;<br />
Now, ye men, spare not your swords!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hew at him with might and main!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the tyrant Count they took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made him kneel upon the floor;<br />
And his bald head off they hewed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hewed it off the bedstead o&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Soon as they the Count had slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Loud the drums the alarum beat;<br />
It was Sir Niels Ebbesen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the town would fain retreat.</p>
<p>From the town he hasted then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dared no longer there to stay;<br />
Soon met him Sir Ove Hals,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And essayed to bar his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou hear, Sir Ove Hals!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do to me no injury!<br />
Thou my faithful cousin art,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Prythee, Ove, let me flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Our affinity I know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I know its near degree;<br />
But my Lord you&rsquo;ve foully slain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Niels! I will not let thee flee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bleat the sheep, the ganders hiss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Crows the cock upon the wall;<br />
Ove Hals was sore beset,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must to the Holsteiners call.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Gainst the Danes he could not stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must to the Holsteiners call;<br />
&ldquo;Murdered is your liege the Count<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Up, and on his butchers fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fight Sir Ove and Sir Niels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ebbesen he would not fly,<br />
He Sir Ove&rsquo;s head smote off,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Left the corse in blood to lie.</p>
<p>Ebbesen to Randers bridge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came, there grew the combat hot,<br />
There he found the tiny Frost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had late dismissal got.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>Niels sped over Randers bridge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Holstein&rsquo;s men came thronging after;<br />
What did then the tiny Frost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But the bridge drop in the water.</p>
<p>Thanks to Niels&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well he served his uncle then;<br />
In the firth the planks he cast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No bridge found the Holstein men.</p>
<p>Niels a widow visited,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;d but barley bannocks two,<br />
One she gave to Niels, because<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He the hairless tyrant slew.</p>
<p>Ebbesen!&nbsp; God sain thy soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Never was a braver Dane;<br />
Thou didst free thy fatherland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From a foreign tyrant&rsquo;s chain.</p>
<p>Christ bless every gallant man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who shall both with mouth and hand,<br />
In the time of its distress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek to serve his fatherland!</p>

22</span>GERMAND GLADENSWAYNE</h2>
<p>Our King and Queen sat o&rsquo;er the board<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In high festivity;<br />
Between them there was much discourse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; About the briny sea.</p>
<p>Our gallant King and youthful Queen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sailed across the foam;<br />
Much better had it been for both<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That they had stayed at home.</p>
<p>But barely they a mile had gone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When still the vessel stood,<br />
There came a raven wild, who strove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To sink them in the flood.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;If any thing the ship doth hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concealed beneath the main,<br />
I&rsquo;ll give thee, bird, a lump of gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set it free again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O do not sink us in the sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Swart bird,&rdquo; exclaimed the Queen,<br />
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll give thee a lump of gold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weighs Bismer pounds fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold and silver I heed them not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I crave another fee,<br />
The treasure neath thy girdle fair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou now must promise me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of gold I have myself,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From gold no help you&rsquo;ll find,<br />
On what beneath your girdle&rsquo;s hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve firmly set my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give what neath my girdle&rsquo;s hid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My bunch of keys&mdash;what more?<br />
I&rsquo;ll speedily have others forged<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I but win to shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Then straight she took the little keys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cast them overboard;<br />
Away then flew the Raven, glad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had obtained her word.</p>
<p>The Queen walks on the yellow sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then o&rsquo;er her came a gloom,<br />
She felt that Germand Gladenswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was quick within her womb.</p>
<p>And from that day when five short months<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her head had flitted o&rsquo;er,<br />
The Queen she went to the chamber high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a lovely son she bore.</p>
<p>Born was he in the evening hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They christened him at night;<br />
They called him Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Concealed him whilst they might.</p>
<p>They fostered him a winter&rsquo;s space,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They fostered him for nine;<br />
The fairest youth he grew on whom<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sun did ever shine.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>So well he throve, so well he grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His horse he well could ride,<br />
Whene&rsquo;er his mother on him gazed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So woefully she sigh&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now list to me, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I fain would know;<br />
Why dost thou sigh so piteously<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whene&rsquo;er I past thee go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now hear thou, Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve cause to be forlorn;<br />
Beguiled I gave thee to a fiend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before thou yet wast born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do thou hear, my mother dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All sorrow cast aside:<br />
Whatever be the will of God<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By that I must abide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It chanced upon a harvest morn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The breezes scarcely stirr&rsquo;d,<br />
That as the chamber door stood ope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So wild a yell was heard.</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>In came the laidly bird of prey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood the Queen before:<br />
&ldquo;Dost thou remember, gracious Queen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy gift to me of yore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She swore by God, and by the saints,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By all that&rsquo;s good she swore,<br />
That son nor daughter in the world<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She never, never bore.</p>
<p>Then flew away the bird of prey,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With an eldritch shriek he&rsquo;s flown:<br />
&ldquo;Whene&rsquo;er I meet Germand Gladenswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll remember he&rsquo;s my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Germand fifteen years had reached<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;d fain a damsel wed;<br />
He loved the daughter of England&rsquo;s king,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The angel-lovely maid.</p>
<p>His longing to be with his plighted maid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He might no more withstand:<br />
&ldquo;O how shall I come across the foam<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the flood-encircled land?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>It was Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He donned his best array;<br />
And he has ta&rsquo;en to his mother dear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the lofty hall his way.</p>
<p>In came Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In scarlet clad was he:<br />
&ldquo;O mother lend me thy feather robe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To fly across the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feather robe hangs upon the crook,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The feathers droop so low,<br />
If thou dost fly to the foreign land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall see thee never moe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pinions are so broad that they<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grow heavy in the air,<br />
I&rsquo;ll have another made for me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I live another year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set himself in the feather robe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flew o&rsquo;er the ocean straight;<br />
And there met him the raven wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a rock did wait.</p>
<p><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>He flew up, and he flew down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He flew in fearless guise;<br />
And when he reached the midst of the sea<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He heard a frightful voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, well met, Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er long hast thou delay&rsquo;d;<br />
Thou wast but little when to me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A present thou wast made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O let me fare, O let me fly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To speak my maiden dear;<br />
Be sure that I, when her I&rsquo;ve seen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Again will meet thee here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will let thee fly, but still<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My mark on thee will set,<br />
Lest thou midst knights and beauteous dames<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy raven lord forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out the boy&rsquo;s right eye he tore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drank up half his blood;<br />
But still he reached the bower of his bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His heart was yet so good.</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>He set himself by the Damsels&rsquo; bower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All bloody and distrest;<br />
All the dames within that were<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgot to smile and jest.</p>
<p>All the damsels grew so still,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With horror sat they fast;<br />
Except proud Damsel Adelude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside her work she cast.</p>
<p>All the maids within forsook<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both jest and merry note;<br />
&rsquo;Twas the proud Damsel Adelude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her hands together smote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now welcome, Germand Gladenswayne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hast thou been to play?<br />
Say, why bebloodied are thy clothes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pale thy cheeks as clay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, dear Damsel Adelude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I soon from thee must fly;<br />
For he must have my youthful life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who tore from me my eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Her silver handled comb she took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And strove to comb his head;<br />
For every hair that she did comb<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A briny tear she shed.</p>
<p>For every lock the maiden combed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A stream of tears did run;<br />
How often she the mother cursed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who had betrayed her son.</p>
<p>It was Damsel Adelude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She took him in her arm:<br />
&ldquo;Accursed be the wicked Dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who caused us all this harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, sweet Damsel Adelude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curse not my mother so,<br />
She had no power in this affair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We all to fate must bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set him in his feather robe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And mounted on the wind;<br />
She set her in another robe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And followed fast behind.</p>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;O turn thee, Damsel Adelude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn my beloved one,<br />
Thy bower door doth open stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy keys lie on the stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though my bower door doth open stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And my keys lie on the stone,<br />
Yet I will follow thee to the place<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where harm to thee was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the birds she cut so small<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She met with there on high,<br />
Except the laidly Raven wild,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And him she could not spy.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas the proud Damsel Adelude<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Flew down towards the strand;<br />
Nought found she of the Gladenswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except the good right hand.</p>
<p>She flew so wroth the clouds below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The laidly bird to find;<br />
She flew East, and she flew West,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To slay him she designed.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; Before her knife that came;<br />
But when she met the Raven wild<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into ten she hacked his frame.</p>
<p>And still till she of sorrow died<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She flew across the heath;<br />
It was for Germand Gladenswayne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She suffered grief and death.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
